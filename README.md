- Hover over the red object with your mouse pointer using your hand to score points.
- Press 'r' to restart the game or connect your index finder tip with your thumb tip after it's over.

## Game 2: Maze Game

This game uses hand gestures to control the movement of a player in a maze. Make appropriate gestures to navigate through the maze and reach the finish line.

To play the game, run the `maze.py` and `maze_controls.py` files.

Controls:

## Game 3: Numbers Game

In this game, a random number appears on the screen, and you need to show the corresponding number with your hand. If you show the correct number, a new number appears.
Additionally you can use your keyboard to play.

To play the game, run the `numbers_game.py` and `numbers_game_controls.py` files.

Controls:

## Additional Feature: Hand Gesture Control and Training New Gestures

There's an additional script `hand_gesture_control.py` that demonstrates hand gesture recognition. You can use hand gestures to control various actions like pressing keys on the keyboard.

To use hand gestures, run the `number_game_controls.py` file.

Additionaly the program lets you save images of your hand with a press of "s" key on your keyboard to create your own dataset with hand images.

Next if you put your images to the corresponding folders for training and testing in Data directory you are able to train your model to handle new gestures.

Controls:
